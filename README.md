# Visual-TFT-Quickstart-
Quickstart to help you with your first Visual TFT project. Includes documentation and an example

We use Mikroe development tools for our ARM bases embedded projects. The Mikromedia devices in general and the latest STM32 based version are very pleasant to work with. Mikroe launched some years ago Visual TFT as a tool to quickly develop GUI applications. 

However making a start with your first projects make take more time than anticipated.
So we post here a project/code example and some documentation to find your way in the generated code.

For any questions, feel free to contact us
